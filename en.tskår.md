The T-score shows how your responses compare to those of others who have taken the test.

- The average is 50
- Most people score between 40 and 60
- Each 10 points corresponds to approximately one standard deviation

In this test, this means:

- Higher T-score: your responses show little similarity to the regulation difficulties often seen in ADHD
- Lower T-score: your responses show greater similarity to such difficulties

The T-score is not a diagnosis, but a statistical measure of how typical your responses are compared to a reference group.

It is entirely possible to have a low T-score without having ADHD, and a high T-score while having ADHD.

The test does not determine whether you have ADHD, only how much your responses resemble or do not resemble patterns often associated with ADHD. Many people experience regulation difficulties for different reasons, and many people with ADHD function well in several areas of life.
